##  Mutating Maps

Insert or update an element in map `m`:

```
m[key] = elem
```

Retrieve an element:

```
elem = m[key]
```

Delete an element:

```
delete(m, key)
```

Test that a key is present with a two-value assignment:

```
elem, ok = m[key]
```

If `key` is in `m`, `ok` is `true`. If not, `ok` is `false`.

If `key` is not in the map, then `elem` is the zero value for the map's element type.

*Note*: if `elem` or `ok` have not yet been declared you could use a short declaration form:

```
elem, ok := m[key]
```











## Methods and pointer indirection

Comparing the previous two programs, you might notice that functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

```
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v) // OK
```

while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
```

For the statement `v.Scale(5)`, even though `v` is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically. That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement `v.Scale(5)` as `(&v).Scale(5)`since the `Scale` method has a pointer receiver.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func ScaleFunc(v *Vertex, f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	v.Scale(2)
	ScaleFunc(&v, 10)

	p := Vertex{4, 3}
	p.Scale(3)
	

	fmt.Println(v, p)
}

```





The equivalent thing happens in the reverse direction.

Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type:

```
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))  // OK
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(&v)) // Compile error!
```

while methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // OK
p := &v
fmt.Println(p.Abs()) // OK
```

In this case, the method call `p.Abs()` is interpreted as `(*p).Abs()`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func AbsFunc(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
	fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))

	p := &Vertex{4, 3}
	fmt.Println(p.Abs())
	fmt.Println(AbsFunc(*p))
}

```



## The empty interface

The interface type that specifies zero methods is known as the *empty interface*:

```
interface{}
```

An empty interface may hold values of any type. (Every type implements at least zero methods.)

Empty interfaces are used by code that handles values of unknown type. For example, `fmt.Print` takes any number of arguments of type `interface{}`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i interface{}
	describe(i)

	i = 42
	describe(i)

	i = "hello"
	describe(i)
}

func describe(i interface{}) {
	fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i)
}

```



## Type assertions

A *type assertion* provides access to an interface value's underlying concrete value.

```
t := i.(T)
```

This statement asserts that the interface value `i` holds the concrete type `T`and assigns the underlying `T` value to the variable `t`.

If `i` does not hold a `T`, the statement will trigger a panic.

To *test* whether an interface value holds a specific type, a type assertion can return two values: the underlying value and a boolean value that reports whether the assertion succeeded.

```
t, ok := i.(T)
```

If `i` holds a `T`, then `t` will be the underlying value and `ok` will be true.

If not, `ok` will be false and `t` will be the zero value of type `T`, and no panic occurs.

Note the similarity between this syntax and that of reading from a map.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i interface{} = "hello"

	s := i.(string)
	fmt.Println(s)

	s, ok := i.(string)
	fmt.Println(s, ok)

	f, ok := i.(float64)
	fmt.Println(f, ok)

	f = i.(float64) // panic
	fmt.Println(f)
}

```
